CLIMA,Climate Modeling Alliance,"Using Julia to pioneering a new, data-informed approach to climate modeling","We know that climate change is poised to reshape our world, but we lack clear enough predictions about precisely how. At CliMA, our mission is to provide the accurate and actionable scientific information needed to face the coming changes—to mitigate what is avoidable, and to adapt to what is not. We want to provide the predictions necessary to plan resilient infrastructure, adapt supply chains, devise efficient climate change mitigation policies, and assess the risks of climate-related hazards to vulnerable communities.",https://clima.caltech.edu/,Yes,
CLIMACHALLENGES,Climate Grand Challenges,"Bringing computation to the climate challenge","Anthropogenic climate change will reshape our world, but we lack sufficiently accurate and useful projections of how. The goal of this grand challenge is to provide accurate and actionable scientific information to decision-makers to inform the most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. We envision a novel platform that leapfrogs existing climate decision support tools by leveraging advances in computational and data sciences to improve the accuracy of climate models, quantify their uncertainty, and addresses the trade-off between performance and computation time with attention to industry and government stakeholder needs. First, we will develop a digital twin of the Earth that harnesses more data than ever before to reduce and quantify uncertainties in climate projections. To serve the needs of stakeholders, we will develop emulators of the digital twin tailored to maintain the highest possible accuracy in predicting specific variables, like droughts, floods, or heat waves, while still being easy and fast to run.",https://climategrandchallenges.mit.edu/flagship-projects/bringing-computation-to-the-climate-challenge/,Yes,
JDi4Earth,Convergence of Bayesian inverse methods and scientific machine learning in Earth system models through universal differentiable programming,Differentiable programming to accelerate climate models with machine learning,"Scientific machine learning and differentiable programming has shown a tremendous ability to accelerate scientific simulations and improve the accuracy of models. However, many of the demonstrations have not bubbled up to large-scale scientific infrustructure used in practice. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate SciML and differentiable programming tooling on a full climate model. By using the MIT-CalTech CLIMA climate model as a base, we plan to demonstrate neural parameterizations of ocean models and probabilistic programming for uncertainty quantification on the full-scale Earth system model. This will be fostered by new differentiable programming tools, Diffractor.jl and Enzyme.jl, specializing in high-performance construction of adjoint equations for general purpose code.",https://clima.caltech.edu/,Yes,

SWQU,Composable Next Generation Software Framework for Space Weather Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification,Julia to be backbone of next generation software for space weather forecasting,"The forecasting and reanalysis of space weather events poses a major challenge for many activities in space and beyond. For example, solar storms can damage the power supply infrastructure and computer networks on earth but also impact crucially space exploration and satellite traffic management. As a consequence, improved space weather prediction capabilities can unlock to tremendous societal and economic opportunities such as improved internet coverage via satellite mega-constellations.

This multi-disciplinary project brings together teams from various institutions and fields to extend the computational capabilities in the realm of space weather modeling. As part of a larger NSF and NASA initiative motivated by the White House National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, the main objective of this project is to build a Julia-based, composable, sustainable, and portable open-source software framework for the model-based analysis of space weather. To that end, the project seeks to develop scalable algorithms for simulation of large-scale, high-fidelity models, reduced order modeling, data assimilation, and uncertainty propagation. These algorithms are then integrated and distributed to the wider space weather modeling community in form of a composable software framework build in Julia.",https://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-led-team-will-develop-software-forecast-space-storms-0910,Yes,"https://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-led-team-will-develop-software-forecast-space-storms-0910

MSCOVID,Building an open platform for pandemic modeling,Julia to connect the infectious disease and pandemic modeling community,"Mathematical modeling of infectious disease transmission is an important tool in forecasting future trends of pandemics, such as COVID-19, and in evaluating ""what if"" projections of different interventions. Yet, different models tend to give different results. To draw robust conclusions from modeling, it is important to consider multiple models, which can be facilitated by expanding the modeling community, as models tend to reflect the people that develop them, and by bringing models and model developers together to compare and contrast models. The aims of this project are: to expand and empower the next generation of models and modelers; to act as an incubator for a platform for comparisons of infectious disease models, both in terms of computers and people; and hence enable swift and more robust policy decisions for current and future pandemics.",https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/collaboration/studies-in-pandemic-preparedness/#projects,Yes,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/collaboration/studies-in-pandemic-preparedness/#projects
FORD,Neural Surrogates for Augmenting Models of Complex Dynamical Systems,Julia Lab uses neural PDEs to improve battery performance for electric vehicles,"The chemical equations for predicting battery performance are difficult to solve, and thus scientists commonly use many approximations to receive solvable models. However, these approximations can cause loss of predictive accuracy in extreme scenarios, such as in cold weather, which then causes poor performance of simluation-designed battery materials in real-world scenarios. The Julia Lab is developing neural PDE approaches for mixing data with partial differential equations in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to improve the predictive performance. The tools from this project are open sourced as the NeuralPDE.jl repository.",,Yes,

ARPA-E HVAC,Accelerating Coupled HVAC-Building Simulation with a Neural Component Architecture,Julia SciML ecosystem to support the design of more energy efficient buildings,"In conjunction with Julia Computing, Inc., the lab is developing a neural component machine learning tool to reduce the total energy consumption of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings. As of 2012, buildings consume 40 percent of the nation's primary energy, with HVAC systems comprising a significant portion of this consumption. It has been demonstrated that the use of modeling and simulation tools in the design of a building can yield significant energy savings, up to 27 percent of total energy consumption. However, these simulation tools are still too slow to be practically useful. Julia Computing with the Julia Lab seeks to improve upon these tools using the latest computing and mathematical technologies in differentiable programming and composable software to enhance the ability of engineers to design more energy efficient buildings.",https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/projects/accelerating-coupled-hvacbuilding-simulation-neural-component-architecture,Yes,https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/projects/accelerating-coupled-hvacbuilding-simulation-neural-component-architecture

PAPPA,"A Fresh Approach to General, Performant, and Scalable Productivity","Building software at the intersection of performance, portability, and productivity.","Software stacks come with many tradeoffs; a productive environment using Python is slow, C is portable to everything but is a bug-rich environment, and assembly can give you maximum performance combined with a development experience expected of the 1930s. Julia is changing the game to provide a language operating at the intersection of the ""three P's"": performance, productivity, and portability.

The PAPPA project is focused on building out the ecosystem around Julia to ensure that users can easily write correct code once, and which runs everywhere with breakneck performance. Tantamount to this goal is building out packages such as Dagger.jl and KernelAbstractions.jl, which provide modern interfaces for executing code on any device, at any scale.",,Yes,
