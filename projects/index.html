Machine learning potentials promise the accuracy of first-principles methods at a lower computational cost. Simplifying the creation of these potentials &#40;composed of data, descriptors and learning methods&#41; enables systematizing the search for those combinations that exceed the accuracy and performance of the state of the art. This requires the development of new software abstractions and parallel tools.

In Eq. &#40;6.2&#41; and Figure 6.2 they suggest &#40;with a clear caveat&#41; that the growth is n^&#40;2/3&#41; and n^&#40;1/2&#41;. Some years later I histogrammed some values of n maybe 1000, 2000, and 4000 &#40;I&#39;d have to dig it up – buried in my files&#41;, and perhaps I histogrammed g/n^&#40;1/2&#41; or g/n^&#40;2/3&#41; and found one lined up nice and the other did not. See what you can find.</p> <h3 id=generic_lapack ><a href="#generic_lapack" class=header-anchor >Generic LAPACK</a></h3> <p>Over the years people have said that an LAPACK rewritten in Julia could have more interesting properties, and also have a smaller codebase if done carefully. Find something in <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/GenericLinearAlgebra.jl">Generic Linear Algebra.jl</a> that is not there currently and add to it, and check that it runs at least as fast as original LAPACK, but perhaps works on quaternions, or funny number fields, or matrices of matrices etc., and that you can run autodiff on these constructs.</p> <!--<div class=page-foot >--> <!-- <div class=copyright >--> <!-- &copy; {{ fill author }}. {{isnotpage /tag/*}}Last modified: {{ fill fd_mtime }}.{{end}} Website built with <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia programming language</a>.--> <!-- </div>--> <!--</div>--> </div> <footer> <img src="/assets/images/mit-logo.svg" alt=mit  /> <img src="/assets/images/csail-logo.png" alt=mit-csail  /> <img src="/assets/images/mit-math-logo.png" alt=mit-math  /> </footer>
