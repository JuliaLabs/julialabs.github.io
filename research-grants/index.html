Magnetic Navigation presents an alternative GPS system that relies on magnetic resonance of the Earth, a system that is largely known and unchanging, to navigate. Some of the current problems with magnetic navigation involve 1) reducing excess noise on the system, such as magnetic outputs from the Aircraft itself, 2) determining position at a real-time pace or speeds consistent with military systems, and 3) combining with other systems to present a full-alternative GPS system. The present project looks into using robust neural differential models to solve magnetic navigation shortcomings and provide a viable alternative to GPS. <a href="">Website</a> <br><br> <h2 id="ARPA-E CMU" class=header-anchor >High-fidelity Accelerated Design of High-performance Electrochemical Systems</h2> <div> <img style="margin-right:10px;margin-top:-10px" align=left  class=circle  width=120  height=120  src="/assets/research-grants/ARPA-E_CMU"/> </div> This project involves software development efforts for accelerated solution of differential and algebraic equations describing the kinetics of the electrochemical systems, integration of these solvers with machine learning approaches, and global optimization over the chemical design space. The high-value candidates will be tested experimentally, validating the entire approach. We are generating cell-scale battery models from porous-electrode theory (such as the P2D/DFN model) from PyBaMM in ModelingToolkit.jl to leverage the simulating power of the SciML ecosystem - either using Method of Lines (finite differences then ODE/DAE solvers) or by surrogatization with Physics-Informed Neural Networks. We will also develop hybrid models that directly incorporate experimental data into the models. <a href="">Website</a> <br><br> <h2 id="ARPA-E HVAC" class=header-anchor >Accelerating Coupled HVAC-Building Simulation with a Neural Component Architecture</h2> <div> <img style="margin-right:10px;margin-top:-10px" align=left  class=circle  width=120  height=120  src="/assets/research-grants/ARPA-E_HVAC"/> </div> In conjunction with Julia Computing, Inc., the lab is developing a neural component machine learning tool to reduce the total energy consumption of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings. As of 2012, buildings consume 40 percent of the nation's primary energy, with HVAC systems comprising a significant portion of this consumption. It has been demonstrated that the use of modeling and simulation tools in the design of a building can yield significant energy savings, up to 27 percent of total energy consumption. However, these simulation tools are still too slow to be practically useful. Julia Computing with the Julia Lab seeks to improve upon these tools using the latest computing and mathematical technologies in differentiable programming and composable software to enhance the ability of engineers to design more energy efficient buildings. <a href="">Website</a> <br><br> <h2 id=MSCOVID  class=header-anchor >Building an open platform for pandemic modeling</h2> <div> <img style="margin-right:10px;margin-top:-10px" align=left  class=circle  width=120  height=120  src="/assets/research-grants/MSCOVID"/> </div> Mathematical modeling of infectious disease transmission is an important tool in forecasting future trends of pandemics, such as COVID-19, and in evaluating "what if" projections of different interventions. Yet, different models tend to give different results. To draw robust conclusions from modeling, it is important to consider multiple models, which can be facilitated by expanding the modeling community, as models tend to reflect the people that develop them, and by bringing models and model developers together to compare and contrast models. The aims of this project are: to expand and empower the next generation of models and modelers; to act as an incubator for a platform for comparisons of infectious disease models, both in terms of computers and people; and hence enable swift and more robust policy decisions for current and future pandemics. <a href="">Website</a> <br><br> <h2 id=CESMIX  class=header-anchor >Center for the Exascale Simulation of Materials in Extreme Environments</h2> <div> <img style="margin-right:10px;margin-top:-10px" align=left  class=circle  width=120  height=120  src="/assets/research-grants/CESMIX"/> </div> The Center for Exascale Simulation of Materials in Extreme Environments (CESMIX) seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in predictive simulation by connecting quantum and molecular simulations of materials with state-of-the-art programming languages, compiler technologies, and software performance engineering tools, underpinned by rigorous approaches to statistical inference and uncertainty quantification. Our motivating problem is to predict the degradation of complex (disordered and multi-component) materials under extreme loading, inaccessible to direct experimental observation. This application represents a technology domain of intense current interest, and exemplifies an important class of scientific problems - involving material interfaces in extreme environments. <a href="">Website</a> <br><br> <h2 id=SWQU  class=header-anchor >Composable Next Generation Software Framework for Space Weather Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification</h2> <div> <img style="margin-right:10px;margin-top:-10px" align=left  class=circle  width=120  height=120  src="/assets/research-grants/SWQU"/> </div> The forecasting and reanalysis of space weather events poses a major challenge for many activities in space and beyond. For example, solar storms can damage the power supply infrastructure and computer networks on earth but also impact crucially space exploration and satellite traffic management. As a consequence, improved space weather prediction capabilities can unlock to tremendous societal and economic opportunities such as improved internet coverage via satellite mega-constellations. This multi-disciplinary project brings together teams from various institutions and fields to extend the computational capabilities in the realm of space weather modeling. As part of a larger NSF and NASA initiative motivated by the White House National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, the main objective of this project is to build a Julia-based, composable, sustainable, and portable open-source software framework for the model-based analysis of space weather. To that end, the project seeks to develop scalable algorithms for simulation of large-scale, high-fidelity models, reduced order modeling, data assimilation, and uncertainty propagation. These algorithms are then integrated and distributed to the wider space weather modeling community in form of a composable software framework build in Julia. <a href="">Website</a> <br><br> <h2 id=NORWAY  class=header-anchor >Digital Wells for Optimal Production and Drainage (DigiWell)</h2> <div> <img style="margin-right:10px;margin-top:-10px" align=left  class=circle  width=120  height=120  src="/assets/research-grants/NORWAY"/> </div> Affordable and clean energy for everyone, and actions for an improved climate, are two of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Any realistic energy solution must combine the entire portfolio of possible energy sources with a gradual transition from the current fossil based economy to a fully sustainable energy economy. To improve the climate in this transition, energy efficiency in oil production must be maximized together with profit. The project aims at developing new methods, algorithms, and tools for oil production with maximized profit and minimum energy consumption under uncertain information. Uncertainties relate to (i) unknown future prices/cost, (ii) uncertainties in operational allocation, and (iii) uncertain knowledge of reservoir and equipment. <a href="">Website</a> <br><br> <br><br> <!--<div class=page-foot >--> <!-- <div class=copyright >--> <!-- &copy; {{ fill author }}. {{isnotpage /tag/*}}Last modified: {{ fill fd_mtime }}.{{end}} Website built with <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia programming language</a>.--> <!-- </div>--> <!--</div>--> </div> <div class=footer > <center> <img width=150  src="/assets/images/mit-logo.svg" /> <img width=150  src="/assets/images/csail-logo.png" /> <img width=150  src="/assets/images/mit-math-logo.png" /> </center> </div> <!--<div class=page-foot >--> <!-- <div class=copyright >--> <!-- &copy; {{ fill author }}. {{isnotpage /tag/*}}Last modified: {{ fill fd_mtime }}.{{end}} Website built with <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia programming language</a>.--> <!-- </div>--> <!--</div>-->
